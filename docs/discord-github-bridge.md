## 🧷 PDF-Safe Brand Rule

Discord may use expressive emoji. Official PDFs, contracts, manifests, and exported documents should not rely on emoji as live text.

Use vector marks or embedded SVG/PNG icons instead:

```text
[ Legal entity ] Design Orchard LLC
[ Microscope Mark ] DrMarchand’s Lab⚛︎ratory™
[ API Mark ] API
[ Library Mark ] DrMarchand’s Library™
[ Execution system ] DrMarchand’s ⚙︎ Nɛuro-Forge Engine™
[ Canvas Mark ] Creative Canvas
```

Safe text symbols:

```text
™
℠
©
•
→
∞
⚛︎
⚙︎
```

Convert these to graphics in official exports:

```text
🌴
🔬
📚
🎨
🧬
```

## 🛡️ Bridge Rule

Keep private connection strings and automation credentials out of public documentation. Store them only in the proper platform settings.
